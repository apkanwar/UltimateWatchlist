# Ultimate Library

Ultimate Library keeps your anime, TV shows, and dramas in sync across devices. It combines online discovery with your personal media library so you can:
- Discover curated recommendations for anime and TV shows.
- Track what you are watching, have finished, or plan to watch.
- Link local media folders and resume playback right where you left off.
- Sync the entire library with iCloud so it is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

To get started, open the Xcode project, add your MyAnimeList and TVMaze API credentials in `Info.plist` (or environment variables), and run the `UltimateWatchlist` target. Store any personal media on iCloud Drive to unlock the cross-device playback workflow.
